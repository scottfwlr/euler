# multilingual projecteuler

Solving and re-solving questions in multiple programming languages to develop basic familiarity with them. Avoiding just re-implementing my first solution in new syntax, instead aiming for idiomatic fashion, taking advantage of the language's strengths and compensating for its weaknesses.

## compare.??

Quick script to grab each solution for a given problem and output a markdown document with them right next to each other. Ideally, using github syntax highlighting.
