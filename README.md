# multilingual projecteuler

### description

Solving and re-solving questions in multiple programming languages to get my fingers used to them. Avoiding just re-implementing my first solution in new syntax, instead aiming for the idiomatic fashion of the language, taking advantage of the language's strengths, and compensating for its weaknesses.


#### compare.rb and compare.md

A script to grab each solution for each problem and output a markdown document with them right next to each other. Prettily presented using github syntax highlighting.
